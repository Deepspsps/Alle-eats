                <p class="post-text">

                    A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to a specific protein in a particular food. 
                    When the immune system identifies this protein (known as an allergen) as a threat, it releases histamines and other chemicals, leading to a range of symptoms that can vary from mild discomfort to life-threatening reactions. 
                    The eight most common allergenic foods, often referred to as the "Big Eight," include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.
