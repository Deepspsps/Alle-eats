                        <p class="post-text"><br>
                            Apples are generally considered a healthy fruit, but for some individuals, they can trigger allergic reactions. Apple allergies are 
                            typically associated with a condition known as oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or pollen-food syndrome, which occurs due to cross-reactivity 
                            between certain proteins in apples and pollen from trees or other plants.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            In OAS, the immune system recognizes similar proteins in both the pollen and certain fruits or vegetables, leading to 
                            allergic reactions when consuming those foods. In the case of apples, the primary culprit is often a protein called Mal d 1, 
                            which is structurally similar to proteins found in birch tree pollen. Individuals who are allergic to birch pollen may experience 
                            allergic reactions to apples due to this cross-reactivity.
                        </p>

                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>Symptoms of an apple allergy or OAS can include:</h2>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>1. Itchy Mouth or Throat:</b> Sensations of itching, tingling, or swelling in the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat immediately or shortly after eating apples.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>2. Skin Reactions: </b>Some people might experience skin reactions such as hives, itching, or eczema after consuming apples.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>3. Respiratory Problems:</b>In rare instances, individuals might experience symptoms like nasal congestion, sneezing, or coughing.
                            </p>
        
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>4. Gastrointestinal Issues:</b>  Symptoms like stomach pain, nausea, or diarrhea can occur in more severe cases.
                            </p>
                            
                            <br>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                It's important to note that cooking apples can sometimes break down the proteins responsible for the allergic reaction, reducing the 
                                likelihood of a reaction for some individuals. However, this isn't always the case, and it varies depending on the person and the specific proteins involved.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>In Conclusion</h2>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                People with known birch pollen allergies or OAS should be cautious when consuming raw apples. Peeling the 
                                apple or opting for apple varieties that might have lower levels of the specific proteins might help reduce 
                                the risk of a reaction. Consulting an allergist or healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management 
                                strategies is crucial for individuals experiencing apple-related allergic symptoms.
