            <h2><br>What are allergies?</h2>
         <p>Allergies are a common medical condition that occurs when the immune system reacts
            abnormally to a foreign substance, known as an allergen. Symptoms of allergies can range
            from mild to severe and can include sneezing, itching, hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.
            Allergies can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle
            choices.The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to anaphylaxis
            — a potentially life-threatening emergency. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments and changes in diet
            can help relieve your allergy symptoms.</p>
        
           <h2><br>When to see a doctor?</h2>
                <p>You might see your health care provider if you have symptoms you think are caused by an allergy, and 
                nonprescription allergy medications don't provide enough relief. If you have symptoms after starting a 
                new medication, call the provider who prescribed it right away.</p>
