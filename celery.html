                        <p class="post-text"><br>
                            Celery allergy, while not as common as some other food allergies, can trigger significant allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. The allergy 
                            usually occurs due to certain proteins present in celery that are mistakenly identified as harmful by the immune system.
                            <br><br>
                            One key protein in celery responsible for triggering allergic responses is called Api g 1. When someone with a celery allergy consumes celery or foods 
                            containing celery derivatives, their immune system recognizes this protein as a threat. This recognition prompts the immune system to produce specific 
                            antibodies, mainly immunoglobulin E (IgE), to fight off what it perceives as an invader.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            Upon subsequent exposure to celery proteins, these IgE antibodies signal immune cells to release histamine and other chemicals. This immune response 
                            leads to the manifestation of allergic symptoms.
                        </p>

                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>Symptoms of a celery allergy can range from mild to severe and may include:</h2>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>1. Skin Reactions: </b> Hives, eczema, itching, or swelling, often appearing as redness or rashes on the skin.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>2. Digestive Issues: </b> Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea might occur after consuming celery.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>3. Respiratory Problems:</b>Some individuals might experience nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, or even difficulty breathing, particularly in severe cases.
                            </p>
        
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>4. Oral Symptoms:</b>  Itching or tingling sensations in the mouth, lips, or throat upon eating celery.
                            </p>
                            
                            <br>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                In rare instances, a celery allergy can lead to anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction characterized by a sudden drop 
                                in blood pressure, constriction of airways, and systemic shock.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>In Conclusion</h2>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                Celery can be present in various foods, including soups, salads, stews, sauces, and even certain spice mixes or processed foods. 
                                Cross-reactivity between celery and certain other foods like birch pollen or mugwort pollen can also trigger allergic reactions 
                                in individuals with pollen allergies.
                            <br><br>
                                Avoidance of celery and celery-containing products is the primary strategy for managing a celery allergy. Careful reading of 
                                food labels and discussing dietary restrictions with healthcare professionals is essential to prevent accidental exposure and 
                                manage symptoms effectively.
