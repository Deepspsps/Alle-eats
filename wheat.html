                            Wheat allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to proteins found in wheat. The primary proteins responsible for triggering allergic reactions in wheat are 
                            gliadin and glutenin. When someone with a wheat allergy ingests or comes into contact with wheat proteins, their immune system mistakenly identifies these proteins 
                            as harmful and produces antibodies, particularly immunoglobulin E (IgE), to fight them.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            This immune response leads to the release of histamine and other chemicals, causing allergic symptoms. 
                        </p>
                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>The symptoms of a wheat allergy can range from mild to severe and might include:
                            </h2>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>1. Skin Reactions: </b> Hives, eczema, redness, itching, or swelling might occur on the skin after exposure to wheat or wheat-containing products.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>2. Digestive Issues: </b>Abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or in severe cases, potentially life-threatening reactions like anaphylaxis.

                            <p class="post-text"> <b>3. Respiratory Problems:</b> Symptoms can include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing.

                            <p class="post-text">Wheat allergy differs from gluten intolerance or celiac disease. In celiac disease, the immune system responds to gluten by damaging the lining 
                                of the small intestine, leading to various health issues. Meanwhile, wheat allergy involves an immune response to specific proteins in wheat, often distinct from gluten.

                                The exact cause of wheat allergies isnâ€™t fully understood, but factors like genetic predisposition and environmental influences are believed to play a role. Additionally, 
                                some individuals might outgrow wheat allergies as they age, but others may have lifelong allergies.
                            </p>

                            <p class="post-text">
                                Avoiding wheat and wheat-containing products is the primary management strategy for individuals with wheat allergies. This includes being vigilant about reading food 
                                labels, as wheat can be present in various forms like flour, bread, pasta, sauces, and processed foods. Wheat might also be found in non-food items like cosmetics or play dough.
                                <br><br>
                                Consulting an allergist or healthcare professional is crucial for accurate diagnosis and guidance on managing a wheat allergy. They can help with creating a suitable 
                                diet plan and addressing potential risks of accidental exposure to wheat proteins.
