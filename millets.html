                        <p class="post-text"><br>
                            Millets are generally considered hypoallergenic, meaning they're less likely to cause allergic reactions compared to common allergens like wheat or
                            soy. However, while rare, some individuals may still experience allergic reactions to specific proteins present in millets.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            Allergies to millets are relatively uncommon but can occur due to the presence of certain proteins that might trigger an immune response in sensitive 
                            individuals. The proteins implicated in millet allergies can vary depending on the specific type of millet consumed. For instance, proteins like prolamins 
                            and glutelins found in millets such as finger millet (ragi), pearl millet, sorghum, or foxtail millet could potentially cause allergic reactions.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            When someone allergic to specific millet proteins consumes these grains or products containing millets, their immune system might recognize these 
                            proteins as harmful. Consequently, the immune system produces antibodies (such as IgE antibodies), which initiate an immune response, leading to various allergic symptoms.    
                        </p>

                            <p class="post-text"> <b>1. Skin Reactions: </b> Itching, hives, eczema, or swelling might occur after consuming millet or millet-based foods.

                            <p class="post-text"> <b>4. Anaphylaxis:</b>  In severe cases, millet allergies can trigger a potentially life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis, 
                            characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure, constriction of airways, and systemic shock.
                            </p>

                                Cross-contamination or mislabeling of food products might also contribute to allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to millet proteins.

                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>In Conclusion</h2>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                If someone suspects a millet allergy, consulting an allergist or healthcare provider for proper diagnosis is crucial. Avoiding millets and products 
                                containing millet ingredients is the primary strategy for managing millet allergies. Reading food labels carefully and being vigilant about potential 
                                sources of millet in processed foods can help prevent allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.
