                        <p class="post-text"><br>
                            Paneer, a type of fresh cheese commonly used in South Asian cuisines, is made by curdling heated milk with an acidic ingredient like lemon juice or vinegar.
                            While paneer is a dairy product, it contains a relatively high concentration of milk proteins, particularly casein and whey. These proteins can trigger allergic 
                            reactions in individuals sensitive or allergic to milk.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            When someone with a milk protein allergy consumes paneer or dishes containing paneer, their immune system may identify these proteins as harmful substances. This 
                            recognition prompts the immune system to produce antibodies, particularly immunoglobulin E (IgE), as a defense mechanism. Upon subsequent exposure to paneer, these 
                            IgE antibodies trigger the release of histamine and other chemicals, leading to an allergic reaction.   
                        </p>

                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>Symptoms of a paneer allergy can vary in severity and may include:</h2>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>1. Skin Reactions: </b>Itching, hives, eczema, or swelling on the skin are common allergic responses after consuming paneer. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>2. Digestive Issues: </b> Gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cramps might occur.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>3. Respiratory Problems:</b>Some individuals might experience coughing, wheezing, nasal congestion, or difficulty breathing as part of their allergic reaction.
                            </p>
        
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>4. Anaphylaxis:</b>  In severe cases, an allergic reaction to paneer can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden drop in
                                blood pressure, constriction of airways, and systemic shock. This requires immediate medical attention.
                            </p>
                            
                            <br>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                Cross-contamination during paneer production or the presence of milk proteins in other ingredients mixed with paneer can also contribute to allergic reactions.   
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>In Conclusion</h2>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                For those with known milk protein allergies or sensitivities, avoiding paneer and closely inspecting food labels for milk or dairy-derived ingredients is crucial.
                                Substitutes made from non-dairy sources, such as tofu or plant-based cheeses, can be alternatives for individuals avoiding paneer due to allergies.
                                <br>
                                Seeking guidance from an allergist or healthcare professional is important for proper diagnosis, management, and the development of a safe dietary plan for 
                                individuals with paneer or milk protein allergies.
