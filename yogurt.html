                            Yogurt allergies, while not as common as other food allergies, can occur due to the proteins found in milk, particularly casein and whey. Yogurt, a
                            dairy product, is created by fermenting milk with live bacteria cultures. During this process, the milk proteins can undergo changes, but they might
                            still retain enough of their original structure to trigger an allergic response in sensitive individuals.    
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            The proteins in yogurt, similar to those in milk, can be recognized as foreign invaders by the immune system of someone with a milk protein allergy.
                            When they consume yogurt or yogurt-based products, their immune system can react by producing antibodies (IgE antibodies) that recognize these proteins as
                            threats. This immune response leads to the release of histamine and other chemicals, causing allergic symptoms.

                            <p class="post-text">
                                For individuals with known milk protein allergies, avoiding yogurt and yogurt-based products is crucial. Reading food labels carefully to identify any milk or dairy-derived ingredients is essential. In some cases, individuals might tolerate yogurt alternatives made from non-dairy sources like soy, almond, coconut, or oat milk.

                                Consulting an allergist or healthcare provider is essential for proper diagnosis, guidance on dietary restrictions, and management of yogurt or milk protein allergies.
