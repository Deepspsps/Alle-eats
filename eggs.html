                            Egg allergies occur when the immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in eggs 
                            as harmful substances. The two main proteins in eggs that often trigger allergic 
                            reactions are found in the egg whites: ovomucoid and ovalbumin, although other proteins can also be involved.   
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            When someone with an egg allergy consumes eggs or egg-containing products, their immune system reacts by 
                            producing antibodies, specifically immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, to combat these perceived threats. 
                            Upon subsequent exposure to egg proteins, these IgE antibodies signal immune cells to release histamine and 
                            other chemicals, causing allergic symptoms.

                                Egg allergies are more common in children, and many children outgrow them by the age of five. However, 
                                some individuals may continue to be allergic throughout their lives.
                                <br><br>
                                The proteins in eggs can be present in various foods, baked goods, and even in some vaccines, making 
                                avoidance challenging. Reading food labels diligently and being cautious when dining out or consuming 
                                processed foods is crucial for those with egg allergies.
                            </p>

                            <p class="post-text">
                                It's worth noting that while egg allergies can be challenging to manage, they differ from egg intolerance. 
                                Intolerance typically involves difficulty digesting eggs due to enzyme deficiencies, such as in the case of 
                                lactose intolerance with milk. Unlike allergies, intolerances do not involve the immune system.
                                <br><br>
                                Consulting an allergist or healthcare professional is essential for proper diagnosis and guidance on 
                                managing egg allergies. They can provide strategies for avoidance, potential desensitization options, 
                                and advice on handling allergic reactions if they occur.
