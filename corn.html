                            Corn allergies occur when the immune system identifies certain proteins in corn as harmful, triggering an allergic response. The specific proteins in corn
                            responsible for allergic reactions aren't fully understood, but various components within corn can lead to allergic symptoms.   
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            One potential allergen in corn is zein, a protein found in the endosperm of corn kernels. Zein can provoke an immune response in some individuals. 
                            Another possible culprit is lipid transfer protein, which can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals when exposed to corn or corn-derived products.

                            <p class="post-text">
                                When someone with a corn allergy consumes corn or corn-based products, their immune system recognizes these proteins as threats and produces antibodies, 
                                such as IgE antibodies, to fight them. This immune response leads to the release of histamine and other chemicals, causing allergic symptoms.

                            <p class="post-text"> <b>4. Anaphylaxis:</b> In severe cases, a corn allergy can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure, constriction of airways, and systemic shock.

                                Corn and its derivatives are prevalent in various foods and products, making it challenging to avoid. It's commonly found in processed foods, sweeteners like corn syrup, and even in non-food items like medications or personal care products.

                                For individuals with a corn allergy, strict avoidance of corn and corn-derived ingredients is essential. Reading food labels meticulously and being cautious about 
                                cross-contamination is crucial to prevent allergic reactions. Consulting an allergist or healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and guidance on managing a corn allergy is advisable.
