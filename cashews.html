                        <p class="post-text"><br>
                            Cashew allergies occur when the immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in cashew nuts as harmful invaders. 
                            These proteins, such as Ana o 1 and Ana o 2, trigger an immune response in susceptible individuals.    
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            Upon consumption, the immune system of someone with a cashew allergy recognizes these proteins as foreign 
                            substances and produces specific antibodies, mainly immunoglobulin E (IgE), in response to combat the 
                            perceived threat. Subsequent exposure to cashew proteins can lead to the release of histamine and other 
                            chemicals, causing allergic symptoms.
                        </p>

                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>The symptoms of a cashew allergy can vary in severity and may include:</h2>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>1. Skin Reactions: </b> Itching, hives, eczema, redness, or swelling may appear on the 
                                skin after contact with or consumption of cashews.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>2. Digestive Issues: </b>Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, or cramps might occur 
                                soon after eating cashews.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>3. Respiratory Problems:</b>Some individuals might experience nasal congestion, sneezing, 
                                coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing as part of an allergic reaction.
                            </p>
        
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>4. Anaphylaxis:</b>  In severe cases, a cashew allergy can lead to anaphylaxis, a 
                                life-threatening reaction characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure, throat swelling, breathing 
                                difficulties, and even loss of consciousness. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical attention.
                            </p>

                            <p class="post-text">
                                Cross-reactivity can also occur between cashews and other tree nuts or seeds due to similarities in protein structures, 
                                leading to allergic reactions in individuals allergic to one or more of these foods.
                            </p>

                            <p class="post-text">
                                Avoidance of cashews and cashew-containing products is the primary management strategy for those with a cashew allergy.
                                 Checking food labels for cashew ingredients and being cautious about cross-contamination is crucial. 
                                 Additionally, individuals with cashew allergies are often advised to carry epinephrine auto-injectors 
                                 in case of severe allergic reactions.
                                 <br><br>
                                 Consulting an allergist or healthcare professional for proper diagnosis, guidance on managing allergies, 
                                 and creating an emergency action plan is essential for individuals with cashew allergies.
