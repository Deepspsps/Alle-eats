                        <p class="post-text"><br>A milk allergy is one of the most common types of food allergy. Your immune system overreacts to one or
                            more of the proteins in milk you’ve ingested (eaten or drunk). Cow’s milk is the most common cause of a milk allergy. However,
                            other types of animal milk, including goat’s milk and sheep’s milk, may cause your immune system to react.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            The primary proteins responsible for milk allergies are casein and whey. When someone with a milk allergy consumes milk or products
                            containing milk, their immune system overreacts to these proteins, triggering an allergic reaction.
                            <br>
                            In an allergic response, the body's immune system perceives these proteins as threats and produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies 
                            to combat them. Upon subsequent exposure to milk proteins, these IgE antibodies signal immune cells to release histamine and other chemicals,
                            leading to various allergic symptoms.
                        </p>
        
                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>Symptoms of a milk allergy can range from mild to severe and may include:</h2>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>1. Digestive Issues:</b>  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain might occur shortly after consuming milk or milk products.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>2. Skin Reactions: </b> Hives, eczema, itching, or swelling around the mouth or other parts of the body can manifest as an allergic response.</p>
                            
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>3. Respiratory Problems:</b> Wheezing, nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, or even difficulty breathing might occur, particularly in severe cases known as anaphylaxis.</p>
        
                            <p class="post-text"> <b>4. Other Symptoms:</b> In some instances, milk allergies can lead to a drop in blood pressure, dizziness, or even anaphylactic shock, which is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate medical attention.</p>
                            
                            <br>
                            <p class="post-text">Milk allergies are more common in children than adults. Fortunately, many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of three, although
                                some may continue to be allergic throughout their lives. Avoidance of milk and milk products is the primary strategy for managing milk allergies. Food labels
                                must be carefully checked, as milk proteins can be present in unexpected foods such as baked goods, processed meats, and even some medications.</p>
                            
                            <h2 class="sub-heading"><br>In Conclusion</h2>
                            <p class="post-text">It's important to differentiate between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, the sugar in milk, due to a deficiency
                            of the enzyme lactase. While it can cause similar symptoms like digestive discomfort, it is not an immune system response and is distinct from a milk allergy.

                            Consulting an allergist or immunologist is essential for accurate diagnosis and to develop an appropriate management plan for individuals with a milk allergy.<br><br></p>
